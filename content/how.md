## One Feature Development Process in a Nutshell

From project requirements to delivery, here's how we typically work together. Client representatives are usually involved in the initial and final stages, while the tech lead oversees the entire process:

1.  **Project Initiation:** The client approaches our tech lead with a project, requirements, or ideas. This is often done through chat messages, occasionally via long-form text, and rarely through a direct video call.
2.  **Initial Assessment:** The tech lead reviews the request, formulates ideas and questions, and explores alternatives.
3.  **Clarification and Discussion:** A discussion ensues, usually asynchronously via chat or long-form comments, to refine the scope and clarify any uncertainties.
4.  **Early Preparation:** Work can commence even as details are being finalized, with the tech lead initiating preparatory tasks based on the project's foundation.
5.  **Individual Ownership:** A single developer typically handles a task from start to finish, with the tech lead providing support through code reviews, clarifying requirements, and overcoming challenges.
6.  **QA Involvement:** QA participates early on to prepare test cases, often raising design questions from their unique perspective.
7.  **Beta Estimation:** A realistic first beta date is agreed upon after the developer has a clear understanding of the task and is roughly halfway through. We avoid committing to unrealistic deadlines and often request flexibility in scope to accommodate potential estimation inaccuracies.
8.  **Beta Testing and Feedback:** Once the beta version is launched, QA is notified to begin testing. A feedback loop of deploy-test-bug-fix-redeploy is then initiated.
9.  **Client Testing and Sign-Off:** When the beta reaches a satisfactory state, the client is invited to test it on their own devices and initiate the sign-off process.
10. **Release:** The client is usually responsible for releasing the build on platforms like Google PlayStore or AppStore. Alternatively, we proceed with the final build process upon the client's signal.

**Notes:**

*   "Client" refers to anyone involved from the client's side, such as the boss, project manager, designer, or backend programmer.
*   Developers and QAs can make certain decisions independently, but the tech lead oversees all tasks.
*   Large projects are typically broken down into smaller tasks, completed in phases.
*   Long-term projects often involve internal tasks within Else Studio, such as automated testing, refactoring, package maintenance, and addressing technical bugs reported on Sentry.

## Key Features of Our Process

### Direct Line to the Tech Lead

Think of our tech lead as your primary point of contact, the central hub for all communication and decision-making. From that initial spark of an idea to the final polished product, the tech lead is there every step of the way. Got a question? Need to explore different approaches? Bounce ideas off the tech lead. Once the path is clear and the requirements are solid, the tech lead sets the wheels in motion, assigning the task to a developer and getting QA started on those all-important test cases.

Throughout the development process, the tech lead maintains a watchful eye, reviewing code, ensuring alignment with your vision, and clearing any roadblocks that might crop up. If things get tricky and your input is needed, the tech lead will be the one to bring it to your attention. And should any critical issues arise, rest assured, the tech lead is ready to tackle them head-on.

We believe in open communication and collaboration, so be prepared to engage in discussions and answer questions. After all, refining our process and delivering exceptional results requires both parties to be actively involved and committed to continuous improvement.

### Asynchronous Teamwork

We're not fans of endless meetings and rigid schedules. We believe in giving our team the freedom to work when and where they're most productive. That's why we've embraced asynchronous communication, ditching the video call marathons and opting for tools like Basecamp or whatever messaging platform you prefer. This keeps the conversation flowing smoothly, minimizes interruptions, and ensures a crystal-clear record of every decision and discussion.

Think of it as a streamlined, turbocharged workflow that frees you from distractions and keeps the project moving full steam ahead. Our team thrives on this flexibility, delivering top-notch results without sacrificing their sanity (or yours!). Everyone sets their own pace, united by a shared commitment to hitting those beta testing deadlines. It's a win-win situation: our team stays energized and focused, and you get a high-quality product delivered efficiently.

### Rapid Feedback Loops

We believe in keeping things moving. Big projects are broken down into smaller, bite-sized chunks, making it easier to track progress and ensure everything stays on track. We aim for a new beta build every 1-2 weeks, giving you a chance to see the product evolve and provide feedback early and often.

And forget about clunky emulators or third-party testing platforms. We insist on making every build directly testable on your own device, giving you a real-world feel for how things are shaping up. Our QA team is always in the loop, ready to jump on any potential beta deployment and put it through its paces.

Of course, no build goes out the door without passing our rigorous internal QA checks. We're committed to delivering a polished, stable product that meets our high standards and exceeds your expectations. This rapid feedback loop ensures we're always on the same page, catching any issues early and keeping the app alive and well in the wild with happy users knowing it will not fail them.
