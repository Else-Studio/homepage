## A Steady Stream of Success: Delivering Value Consistently

We've been at this for a while now—13 months to be exact. In that time, we've shipped a ton of updates, big and small. 49 production releases, 147 beta releases, over 2000 commits, and more than 300 pull requests. That's a lot of code! But here's the kicker: zero outages caused by our app releases. 

We're proud of our track record. It shows our commitment to delivering value consistently and keeping things running smoothly for SpeedHome and their users.

## New Territory: Building Stuff We've Never Built Before

This wasn't just about adding a new coat of paint to old features. We dove headfirst into creating entirely new things for SpeedHome's app—stuff they'd never had before. No more "make it like the old one, but slightly different." We were in uncharted territory, starting with just rough ideas and basic sketches.

We were involved from the get-go, early enough to chime in on how things should look and feel for the user, and how the API could work to ease our workload later. This meant working closely with their backend team, figuring out how to use their brand new API. Which, let's be honest, was a bit like walking a tightrope—those APIs hadn't been tested in the wild yet, so we had to be extra careful. We also needed to work even closer with the design team since they liked to provide finalized Figma GUI mockups. Matching those high-fidelity visuals with reality is always tough and requires a lot of negotiation and tolerance.

Since we were the ones putting all the pieces together—the backend, the design, the frontend—we were in the best position to spot potential problems. Catching mismatches between the design and the backend wasn't just our responsibility; it was the only way to make our lives easier down the road.

The goalposts shifted too. It wasn't just about matching the old way of doing things; it was about solving their business needs in a whole new way. Sometimes, those needs were a bit fuzzy, but we always managed to nail it. This whole phase proved we could roll with the punches, tackle new challenges head-on, and deliver the goods, even when things got a little unpredictable.

## Building a Team That Gets Stuff Done

We doubled down on our commitment to efficient teamwork and streamlined processes. We knew that giving our developers more freedom and a hands-off approach would not only make them happier but also help them build features and fix bugs faster. This also freed up the tech lead to focus on the bigger picture and discuss strategy with the client. And let's face it, nobody likes to be micromanaged. This approach took that worry off the client's plate, allowing them to trust us to deliver consistently.

Our rock-solid code foundation was a key ingredient in this efficient workflow. By keeping our code clean and organized, we made it easy for everyone—new and experienced developers alike—to jump in and get things done. This meant most tasks could be handled by a single developer, with the tech lead there for backup when needed.

On the QA front, we had to hustle to get a dedicated budget for manual testing, and finding the right QA pro wasn't a walk in the park. But we stuck with it, and it paid off. Once we had a skilled QA on board, with their detailed test cases and timely testing, ElseStudio ended up handling almost all the testing work. This was a huge win for the client's project managers, freeing them up to focus on other things.

This whole experience proved that a well-structured team and streamlined processes are a recipe for success. By giving our team autonomy, building a strong code foundation, and prioritizing thorough QA, we delivered high-quality results without breaking a sweat. It showed the client we're serious about getting things done right.

## Adapting to Change: Rolling with the Punches 

Businesses change, and priorities shift. That's the reality. In this case, SpeedHome needed to pump the brakes on app development and focus their attention elsewhere. We had to downshift—hard. We limited our work to only the essentials, stepping in when critical situations needed a frontend fix.

It wasn't easy, but our flexible team structure allowed us to weather the storm. Everyone was able to adapt and get by during the slowdown. And when SpeedHome was ready to hit the gas again, we were right there with them, ramping back up to full speed in less than a month. This demonstrated our ability to adapt to changing circumstances and remain a reliable partner, even when faced with unexpected turns.

## Keeping the Engine Running: Maintenance and Stability

We all know that shipping new features is important, but keeping the existing app stable and running smoothly is just as crucial. We made sure to mix in regular maintenance and refactoring work alongside new feature development. This meant finding those quieter moments between big releases to upgrade packages, update tools, and squash those pesky bugs that Sentry caught.

Having a dedicated QA professional on board made refactoring and upgrades much safer. Their regression testing on each release gave us the confidence to make changes without worrying about breaking things. This commitment to stability ensured a smooth user experience and prevented any major hiccups along the way.
